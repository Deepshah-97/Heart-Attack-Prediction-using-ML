Heart Attack Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the risk of heart attacks based on patient data. We employ a variety of algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to analyze the data and identify the most relevant features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health-related information about patients, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: New features are created based on existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
Model Selection and Training: Several machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deep Learning Model: A deep learning model with multiple hidden layers is implemented to further improve prediction accuracy.
Results
The neural network model achieved the highest accuracy of 95%. Other models, such as random forest and gradient boosting, also showed promising results. An ensemble model, combining predictions from multiple models, further boosted accuracy to 90%.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting heart attacks and identifying risk factors. The results suggest that deep learning models may be particularly effective in this domain.
